# Jetstream2-MERN-Educational-Resources
## Mimi Pieper

## Objective
Create a MERN based educational resource on Jetstream using Exosphere

## Engagement Todos

### Milestone 1
- [x] Research and document best practices for students to use instances concerning how their accounts are configured, whether they are added to the project, given an instance passcode, or use SSH.
- [x] Research best options for building MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) on Jetstream2.

### Milestone 2
- [x] Test setup on a simple React app to ensure it works, and document setup instructions for installs and configurations.

### Milestone 3
- [x] Research Docker container build as a way to deploy then test, and document Docker container instructions for Jetstream, containing a MERN stack.
- [x] Fully containerized solution. If possible, potentially multiple images with different levels of ‘completeness’ so that professors could choose which level to teach their class.

### Further Work
- [ ] Research why cors is not working
- [ ] Research PM2
